*Day - 1*
Spent a day on researching web - 3 to make a roadmap to follow for the rest of the 50 days

Made the following roadmap using figma ( originally tried making it using adobe illustrator but failed).

*Day - 2*

Spent the day reading on web - 3.

Decided to make a website using js,html,css and host it on github pages to document my theoretical learning and notes. While also learning js which is the next
step on my roadmap.

(Unable to make much progress as I dont know js and also because I have two exams on 18/9/2024).
